# TOCQ: Tackle Opportunity Containment Quotient

This is my repository for my submission to NFL Big Data Bowl 2024. The repository houses the notebooks and markdown files I used for my submission and for calculating the metric behind the scenes. The files are:

1.  `TOCQ- Tackle Opportunity Containment Quotient.ipynb`: The submission notebook
2.  `TOCQ Calculation.ipynb`: The notebook containing the functions required to calculate **TOCQ**, the code for calculating **TOCQ** for the provided data, and code to save the results into a CSV. This notebook also contains the `plot_play` function used to create play plotting GIFs.
3.  `full_dictionary.csv`: The csv containing the necessary values to calculate **TOCQ** for each NFL defensive player for the first half of the 2022 season (rows are player/team combinations).
4.  `games_dictionary.csv`: The csv containing the necessary values to calculate **TOCQ** for each NFL defensive player in each game (rows are game/player combinations).
